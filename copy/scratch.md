Mirage is a real server in all the ways that matter to you as a frontend developer.

Mirage gives you the full power of a server on your own terms, so you as a frontend developer get a real server in all the ways that matter to you.

- completely embraces the frontend workflow

- What if you had everything you needed to write production code from day one?
- you don't want that code to be throwaway code, code that's not ready for production and that breaks in ways you don't expect.

- talking to a real server is much more complicated, and you write code differently than if you were getting data locally
- you weren't writing code for production because your production environment involves more moving parts
- on the one hand you want to be able to work independently, so you can tweak the design without being blocked by the backend team; but on the other hand, you don't want that code to be throwaway code, code that's not ready for production and that breaks in ways you don't expect.

- Mirage gives you the full power of a server on your own terms, so you as a frontend developer get a real server in all the ways that matter to you.

- the fake data that you wrote doesn't account for the complexities of a real server, but Mirage does. And the way it does is by only providing you data through the same interface that you'll get it from a real server in production. So you have all the flexibility of local data, but the way your app accesses that data is the same way it will access data in production. So you're writing code that will work in both production and in development against this fake server.



# What if you had a tool that gave you a real server directly in your frontend environment?

Well, not exactly a real server - but the next best thing.


what you need is a tool that mimics the server in a high fidelity way

lets you build an app that interacts with the network, regardless if your real server is ready or not

 even if you don't have a server.

## You need a tool that makes it easy to reproduce your production environment.

What if you had a tool that embraced your frontend workflow, giving you everything you needed to build out complete, production-ready JavaScript features without having to wait on your production API?


# Building features that involve persistence is even harder – but they shouldn't be.
